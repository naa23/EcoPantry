# Eco Pantry

Eco Pantry is an app that helps you keep track of the groceries you buy. By scanning your grocery receipt, the app identifies what’s in your kitchen and suggests recipes based on those ingredients, focusing on items that are close to expiring so you can use them before they spoil. If you have extra food, you can share it with people nearby, supporting a community-driven approach to reducing waste and promoting sustainability.

## Features

- **Grocery Tracking**: Automatically logs items in your pantry from scanned receipts.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Recommends recipes tailored to the ingredients you already have, prioritizing items nearing expiration.
- **Food Sharing**: Allows you to share surplus food with others in your community.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Spring Boot and MySQL for reliable data management.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI’s Vision API for receipt scanning and image recognition.
- **Security**: Secured by Cloudflare to manage and protect access to AI-generated images.

## Vision

Eco Pantry goes beyond simple pantry tracking; it’s designed to foster sustainable living through mindful food consumption and community sharing. Our mission is to reduce waste, save money, and make eco-friendly habits accessible to everyone.
